    title: "What is SenseRator 2.0?",
    content:
      "SenseRator 2.0 is a computer vision and civil engineering based project, geared towards Pedestrian Safety in urban areas. Utilizing the concept of smart cities, the SenseRator team designed an AI algorithm and utilized Jetson Nano components, so a user may ride a vehicle like a bicycle through an area to record a video. An algorithm then creates a rating based on the observed architecture, which is available for viewing on a React web application. The goal of SenseRator 2.0 is to bring awareness to pedestrian safety and promote safe, walkable urban planning practices. ",

    title: "What is the Pedestrian Safety Flow Index(PSFI)?",
    content: "A rating index detailing the efficiency and safety of which pedestrians can navigate an urban area. This includes sidewalks, crosswalks, tree shade, traffic lights, benches, and street signs. PSFI is calculated mathematically after the algorithm detects, and counts the presence of all factors of the index, before providing a rating which can be viewed publically.",
